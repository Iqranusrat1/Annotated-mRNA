GC content analysis revealed that the DNA sequence has a GC content of approximately 64.6%, indicating a GC-rich coding region. High GC content is commonly associated with protein-coding genes and contributes to increased structural stability and efficiency.
 Repeat analysis using the Sputnik tool showed no significant tandem or microsatellite repeat elements within the DNA sequence. The absence of major repetitive regions suggests genomic stability and supports the identification of this sequence as a functional protein-coding gene.
